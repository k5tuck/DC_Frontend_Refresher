## Closure

- An nested function that accesses the outer function's variables (including arguements)

## Callback

- is an arguement that is a function

### Does it have to be an arrow function?

Nope!

### Does it have to be an anonymous function?

Sometimes...

## Promises

- it's an object
- with a .then() function
  - pass it a callback function
- and it has a .catch() function

- an object that exists in one of three states
  - pending
  - fulfilled
  - rejected
- that are used to organize asynchronous code
- solved the problem of "callback HELL"
  - aka working with deeply nested callback functions
